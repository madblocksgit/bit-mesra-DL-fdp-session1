# bit-mesra-DL-fdp-session1

This case study involves an IoT Sensory dataset which helps the farmers to understand what kind of crop can be yielded.

This dataset involves sensory data uploaded by IoT devices deployed on the agricultural field and following parameters are included:

1. Temperature
2. Humidity
3. pH
4. Rainfall

By using KNN Machine Learning Implementation on TensorFlow, the idea of this case-study is to suggest the kind of crop can be yielded.

This git is created to share and explore the templates that can be used in the FDP Session planned on 14th December by BIT Mesra.

# Usage
sudo python agriculture_crop_prediction_final.py

# Requirements
1. Google Colab or jupyter notebook
2. Flask
3. flask-ngrok
